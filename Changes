Revision history for Supervisor

0.01    21-Sep-2009 K.Esteb
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    20-Oct-2009 K.Esteb
        Added Config::IniFiles as a dependency
	
0.03    01-Nov-2009 K.Esteb
        Apparently the above change got lost with the upload to CPAN.
	
0.04    09-Nov-2009 K.Esteb
        Apparently I forgot about JSON. This is now a dependency. Easy to
          miss dependenices when all your test environments already have 
          those modules installed.
        
0.05    25-Nov-2009 K.Esteb
        Added support for a "debug" switch in supervisor.
        "debug" will now turn on debug messages within the various log files.
        Changed the yield() to delay_add() in start() of Process.pm.
        Added checks for the wheel in _start_process_timeout() and
          _stop_process_timeout() of Process.pm
        Added a kill_process event and corresponding kill_process() method to
          Process.pm.
