Supervisor version 0.05
=======================

The Supervisor modules provide a simple framework to monitor and control
other processes in a *nix like environment. It is partially based on
Supervisord, Proc::Safetynet and POE::Component::Supervisor. For a varity 
of reason these solutions were not practical to install on systems that I had 
to support. So I wrote my own.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

DEPENDENCIES

These modules requires these other modules and libraries:

    POE
    JSON
    Badger
    DateTime
    File::Pid
    Set::Light
    Config::IniFiles

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.

    perldoc Supervisor::Base

There is also sample supervisor and supctl programs in the bin directory 
and sample startup scripts for Debian, RHEL and Novell SUSE in the 
init.d directory.
