Revision history for Supervisor

0.01    21-Sep-2009 K.Esteb
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    20-Oct-2009 K.Esteb
        Added Config::IniFiles as a dependency

0.03    01-Nov-2009 K.Esteb
        Apparently the above change got lost with the upload to CPAN.

0.04    09-Nov-2009 K.Esteb
        Apparently I forgot about JSON. This is now a dependency. Easy to
          miss dependencies when all your test environments already have 
          those modules installed.

0.05    25-Nov-2009 K.Esteb
        Added support for a "debug" switch in supervisor.
        "debug" will now turn on debug messages within the various log files.
        Changed the yield() to delay_add() in start() of Process.pm.
        Added checks for the wheel in _start_process_timeout() and
          _stop_process_timeout() of Process.pm
        Added a kill_process event and corresponding kill_process() method to
          Process.pm.

0.06    09-Dec-2009 K.Esteb
        Added a "logfile" parameter to bin/supervisor so that you can specify
          the log file on Debian. The start-stop-daemon routine does not
          allow you to redirect stdout/stderr.
        Fixed init.d/supervisor.debian to remove some syntax errors
        Fixed init.d/supervisor.rhel to remove syntax errors
        Hmmm, I thought the LSB was supposed to normalize startup files...

0.07    29-Dec-2009 K.Esteb
        Added a Supervisor.pm module for documentation and as a placeholder
          when trying to install from CPAN.

0.08    17-Jun-2010 K.Esteb
        Using the equivalent of kill -0 <pid> to determine if a process is
          active, is not reliable enough, so I switched over to see if the 
          <pid> exists in the /proc name space which is maintained by the
          kernel, so it should be very reliable.
